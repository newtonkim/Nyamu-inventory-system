## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   composer update
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Environment Security**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use strong `APP_KEY` values
   - Secure database credentials

3. **Authentication Security**
   - Implement strong password policies
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Enable CSRF protection

4. **Database Security**
   - Use parameterized queries (Eloquent ORM)
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Implement proper access controls

### For Production Deployment
1. **Server Configuration**
   - Disable debug mode (`APP_DEBUG=false`)
   - Use HTTPS/SSL certificates
   - Configure proper file permissions
   - Enable security headers

2. **Database Security**
   - Use dedicated database users
   - Implement database firewalls
   - Regular security updates
   - Backup encryption

3. **Application Security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use secure session configuration

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Google OAuth integration requires proper configuration
- Session management follows Laravel best practices
- Password hashing uses bcrypt algorithm

### Authorization
- Role-based access control implemented
- Middleware protection for sensitive routes
- Permission checks at controller level

### Data Protection
- Input validation on all forms
- CSRF protection enabled
- XSS prevention through Blade templating
- SQL injection prevention through Eloquent ORM

### File Security
- Uploaded files (if implemented) should be validated
- File storage outside web root recommended
- Proper MIME type checking

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions and will be clearly marked in the changelog. All users are encouraged to update promptly when security patches are available.

## Third-Party Dependencies
